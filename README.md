## Introduction

Tic Tac Toe is a fun, simple game that people of all ages can enjoy! For this fire vs. water version, a 'water droplet' player and 'flame' player face off to see who can collect the most wins. Players can jump right into gameplay on page load. The board will reset after a game is won or declared a draw.

## Features

- Tic Tac Toe is a two player game. Player 1 and player 2 are able to alternate turns until either player is able to get 3 tokens in a row, column, or diagonal on a 3 x 3 game board. Game play also stops if all 9 spaces on the board have been taken and no player has achieved 3 spaces in a row, resulting in a draw.
- After a win or draw, the game board resets for another round of gameplay!
- Upon each win, the player's individual number of wins are displayed within their player column. Total number of wins per player are able to persist across refreshes.
